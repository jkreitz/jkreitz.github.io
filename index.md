## About Me

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Prof. Feng Zhang's lab in the department of Biological Engineering at MIT. 

## Research Interests

I am broadly interested in harnessing macromolecular systems from microbes and their viruses as novel biotechnologies.
- **Programmable therapeutic delivery with microbial nanosyringes:** image recognition, image generation, video captioning
- **Precision antimicrobial therapy with engineered bacteriophages:** meta-learning, incremental learning, transfer learning

## News

- **[Oct. 2023]** Gave the keynote at the KCA annual meeting in Sydney, Australia. 
- **[Mar. 2023]** Our paper describing the development of a novel protein delivery strategy with microbial nanosyringes is published in Nature!
